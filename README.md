# Half-Reality
Where we work together to compile our realistic adaptation of Half-Life.

Please put you suggestions into the "Issues" tab. Please check some of the other issues if you're unsure how to construct yours.
For those new to Github, they aren't necessary issues, its basically a feedback tab for players and playtesters.

Eventually we'll port all existing suggestions to here, but in the meantime, please visit https://trello.com/b/EaJ6W4Ww/half-reality-black-mesa so you hopefully won't create a duplicate suggestion.

Open Issue = has not been seen.
Closed Issue = either fully implemented or discarded. 

Labels:
